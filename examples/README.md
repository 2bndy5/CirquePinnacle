# Examples

This folder contains CirquePinnacle library examples for the various supported platforms/frameworks.

The following folders have examples for the Arduino IDE (and PlatformIO):

- `absolute_mode`
- `relative_mode`
- `anymeas_mode`
- `usb_mouse` uses Arduino framework's `Mouse` object (board dependent).

The `pico_sdk` folder has examples for the RPi Pico SDK.

The `cpython` folder has examples for the CPython bindings.

There is no USB mouse example for `linux` (and consequently `cpython`).
